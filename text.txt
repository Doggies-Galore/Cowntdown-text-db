This is the second day of the livestream, still here, anyone?!!! Thanks to everyone watching.Hello and welcome to Countdown to the end of the school year 2021! We are so glad to have you! There have been many improvments since last years, icluding a live updating scrolling text box (that's this) and date/time indicators. There is also a stream uptime indicator. That shows how long the stream was online! Again we welcome you to Countdown to the end of the school year. I can't believe there are only forty five days left! It really is getting close! Most pepole would ask for subscribers here, but I would rather just say "Enjoy the stream". Happiness is fufuiling enough! Thanks for watching."I like Minecraft and fortnite" - some weirdo online.
