Hello and welcome to Countdown to the end of the school year 2021! We are so glad to have you! There have been many improvments since last years, icluding a live updating scrolling text box (that's this) and date/time indicaters. There is also a stream uptime indicator. That shows how long the stream was online! Again we welcome you to Countdown to the end of the school year................................................ I can't believe there are only forty six days left! It really is getting close! Most pepole would ask for subscribers here, but I would rather just say "Enjoy the stream". Happiness is fufuiling enough! Thanks for watching........................................................
